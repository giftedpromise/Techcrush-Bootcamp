Best Practices for Naming Variables (Conventions)
Use descriptive names and valid characters. It must start with a letter (a-z or A-Z), underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). 
Use camelCase or snake_case
Avoid single-letter variable names
Use const for constants
Variables are case-sensitive: This means myVariable and myvariable are different variables.
You cannot use reserved keywords as variable names. Reserved keywords are words like let, const, function, if, else, etc.

// let - block-scoped variable (Preferred)
let myAge = 5;
let my_name = "Abraham";
// const - constant, cannot be reassigned
const pi = 3.14;
