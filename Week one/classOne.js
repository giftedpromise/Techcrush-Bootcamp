What is Backend Development?
First, what is Backend Development?
Backend development refers to the server-side of an application and everything that communicates 
between the database and the browser (frontend).
Think of the backend as the engine under the hood of a car â€” it is essential for
 functionality but not always visible.

 Responsibilities
1. Server Logic: Handling business logic and application workflows.
2. Database Management: CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with databases.
3.Authentication and Security: User authentication, data protection, role-based access control and secure communication.
