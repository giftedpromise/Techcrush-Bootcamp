Getting started with servers

A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the web address used to locate resources on the internet. It is essential for
accessing websites, APIs, and other services. URLs are structured to convey the necessary information for identifying
and locating a specific resource. Now, letâ€™s talk about components of a URL

Here's an example URL: https://www.example.com:8080/path/to/resource?query=search#section

Protocol (https://):

Specifies the protocol used for the connection, such as http, https, ftp, etc.

https stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, which is an encrypted version of http.

Host (www.example.com):

The domain name or IP address of the server hosting the resource.

The www is a subdomain, while example.com is the main domain.

Port (:8080):

An optional part that specifies the port number on the server for the connection.

Common ports are 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS; if these are used, they are typically omitted in the URL.

Path (/path/to/resource):

Indicates the specific path to a resource on the server.

It follows the domain and is structured like directories or folders.

Query String (?query=search):

Contains data passed to the server, typically in key-value pairs (key=value format).

Multiple parameters are separated by &, e.g., ?key1=value1&key2=value2.
