Node Package Manager
Understanding NPM

npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js.
It's a command-line tool that allows developers to easily share and reuse code, 
and manage project dependencies.

Why is it important?
It simplifies the process of installing, updating, and managing third-party libraries and tools.
